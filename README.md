# Pumpkin Attack
A Halloween-inspired game for the Hololens in which you airtap to fire energy blasts at pumpkins.
Will likely add more monsters in the future. 

I also wanted to see how the game would fair if skipping the "scan the room and process" step that most projects take and allow unbound wandering. For simple hopping pumpkins, maybe not so bad. However it is still limited to a range, so it is probably best to use the spatial processing and understanding scripts in the Holotoolkit in any case.
